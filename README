mini-dak - Partial and lightweight reimplementation of dak

Introduction
------------

This is mini-dak a partial and lightweight reimplementation of dak
(Debian Archive Kit) in shell script and with no database
dependencies, "designed" to host new Debian architectures.

So the main purpose of mini-dak is to run a slave archive for new
Debian ports, taking all sources from the master archive. Source uploads
to the slave archive are supposed to be modifications and porting fixes
for the new architectures.

Setup

Download the sources, and put them for example in '/srv/ftp.foo.org/bin',
